Hello, 
My name is David Gorodetchi. 

Recently I have started to be interested in software testing. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills.
On this site I would like to share all my experience gained from personal studies and researches.
In this order, I started an automated testing course at the end of 2022.
Here I learned: Testing theory and basic concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms and OOP principles.
Next I will learn automated web-selenium testing, API testing and also I will learn the principles of relational databases

I did a GitHub course. Here I learned important information about uploading and importing projects to GitHub, 
keeping projects up to date, resolving conflicts that may arise, and how to work with multiple branches.
My goal is to complete the automated testing course by mid-April, as well as an initiation into databases.

I study automated testing every day with great enthusiasm
I would be happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. 
It is a crucial step in my current carrer goal, to always become better at what I do.
