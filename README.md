Hello, 
My name is David Gorodetchi. 

The dream of coming of age is about to come true. Although I wanted to do computer programming after finishing school, 
I went in the direction of the job: more precisely, to work in the field of construction. Later, after many years, 
I worked as a truck driver. 
But, around 2020, I realized that I have an unfulfilled dream, namely to work in the IT field.

Recently I have started to be interested in software testing. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills.
On this site I would like to share all my experience gained from personal studies and researches.
In this order, I started an automated testing course at the end of 2022.
Here I learned: Testing theory and basic concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms and OOP principles.
Next I will learn automated web-selenium testing, API testing and also I will learn the principles of relational databases

I did a GitHub course. Here I learned important information about uploading and importing projects to GitHub, 
keeping projects up to date, resolving conflicts that may arise, and how to work with multiple branches.
My goal is:
- complete the self-test course by mid-April
- to understand the basic principles of relational databases
- to learn the basics of the Java language and
- next...

I study automated testing every day with great enthusiasm
I would be happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. 
It is a crucial step in my current carrer goal, to always become better at what I do.

Among other strong points, I would like to mention what is predominant:
Logical: I learn everything logically. I associate anything new with familiar things.
Repetition: I don't like doing repeated things, but I always try to find different solutions.
Integrity. My principles and values do not allow me to be incorrect, to cheat or to make errors that would affect inter-human relations.
In their relationships with others, they don't take things personally, which means that they easily get over certain conflicts, and try to maintain good relationships.
I don't like to put things off, but to do them on time.
